These AuthorizationCodeFlow hold all sorts of configurations. from async_spotify.authentification.authorization_flows import AuthorizationCodeFlow auth_flow = AuthorizationCodeFlow ( application_id = 'Your id' , application_secret = 'Your secret' , scopes = [ 'your' , 'scopes' ], redirect_url = 'your.redirect.url' ) # You can also load the auth_code_flow from environment variables. # If the variable does not exist the existing value will not be overwritten. auth_flow . load_from_env () These created auth_flow have to be passed to the SpotifyApiClient . # Create new client api_client = SpotifyApiClient ( auth_flow ) Authorization Code Flow \u00b6 To get a code from Spotify the user has to agree to the scopes your app asks for. For this you create an authorization, let the user visit this url and read the code parameter in the spotify redirect. # Build the authorization url for the users authorization_url : str = api_client . build_authorization_url ( show_dialog = True ) If you have some questions about this process read this spotify article about it. We will assume that you managed to get a code from spotify for a specific user. Now we have to exchange the code for an authorization token, and a refresh token. # Exchange the code for the tokens auth_token : SpotifyAuthorisationToken = await api . get_auth_token_with_code ( code ) After we recieved the auth_token we can start making request. But before we make this we have to create a new client which will be internally used for all the request making. # Create a new client which will handle the request await api_client . create_new_client () # Get information about an album album = await api_client . albums . get_one ( album_id , market = 'DE' , auth_token = auth_token ) # ... Important If you want to shut down your application and don't want to leak requests you have to call the close_client method of the api_client . # Close the client await api_client . close_client () Client Credentials Flow \u00b6 In this case you only have to pass your auth_flow to your SpotifyApiClient and call the get_auth_token_with_client_credentials method.

Look here for every instance variable and the associated classes. # For the albums endpoint api_client . albums . whatever () # For the artist endpoint api_client . artist . whatever () Advanced Configuration \u00b6 If you don't want to pass the auth_token every time you make a request you can instruct the SpotifyApiClient to keep the token in memory. Every time you refresh the token the in memory token will be updated too. So you always have a valid token you can make requests with. If the token expires you will still have to refresh it yourself by calling the refresh_token method, which will returned the updated token. You don't have to pass a token to the method however if you want the internal token to be updated. In addition to that you can limit the simultaneous requests, and the timout if you create a new client. api_client = SpotifyApiClient ( auth_flow , hold_authentication = True ) # And if you already have a auth_token you can pass this token to the constructor api_client = SpotifyApiClient ( auth_flow , hold_authentication = True , auth_token = auth_token ) # Make the requests without passing the auth_token every time album = await api_client . albums . get_one ( album_id ) # Limit the requests and the timeout await api_client . create_new_client ( request_limit = 1500 , request_timeout = 30 ) Exceptions \u00b6 There are multiple exception which could get raised by the SpotifyApiClient . Every exception inherits from the SpotifyBaseError so if you want to catch every spotify exception you can do it with the SpotifyBaseError . The SpotifyError exception gets raised for general usage errors The TokenExpired exception gets raised if the spotify token used for making an api call is expired The RateLimitExceeded exception gets raised if the rate limit is exceeded The SpotifyAPIError exception gets raised for general errors like a invalid album id Each of the exceptions implements the get_json() method which will return the following json: { \"error\" : { \"status\" : 0 , \"message\" : \"\" } } The status is the HTTP status code and if not aplicable the number 0. The message is the reason something failed. try : album = await api_client . albums . get_one ( album_id ) except SpotifyAPIError as error : error = error . get_json () # Do something with the error message Code retrieval with a cookie \u00b6 Normally you have to get the code with the client credential workflow. If your user has already agreed to the scopes, and you have the cookie of the user you can get rid of this process. This is mostly intended for testing purposes, but you could also use it in your production environment in the very unlikely edge case that you have the spotify cookie of your user. You start like normal and create a new SpotifyApiClient . auth_flow = AuthorizationCodeFlow () auth_flow . load_from_env () api_client = SpotifyApiClient ( auth_flow , hold_authentication = True ) # Create a new spotify cookie cookie = SpotifyCookie () # Load the cookie from a file (you can also use the constructor to pass the data) cookies . load_from_file ( 'Path/to/cookie.json' ) # Get the coke with the spotify cookie code = await api . get_code_with_cookie ( cookie ) # Use the retrieved code to get the auth token auth_token = await api . get_auth_token_with_code ( code ) album = await api_client . albums . get_one ( album_id ) await api_client . close_client () Format of the cookie.json { \"sp_t\" : \"a\" , \"sp_dc\" : \"b\" , \"sp_key\" : \"c\" } Token expiration hook \u00b6 If you want to add a hook in case your auth token expires you can pass an instance of your TokenRenewClass to the SpotifyApiClient .
